git history statistics generator with textual output

This file differs from its original version by Hoxu in producing a machine-parsable
text output rather than a series of HTML/CSS pages. 

MAIN INTENTIONS:

1. To produce a machine-readable output

2. To reduce collateral output not necessary for machine readability

3. Optimize speed/complexity since html/css elements removed

PROGRESS:

1. .Txt output has been achieved

2. Script still outputs .dat files (TODO)

3. Script does not consistently insert \n chars, spaces seem haphazardly distributed

4. Script is not appreciably faster.
